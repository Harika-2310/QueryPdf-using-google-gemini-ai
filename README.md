# QueryPdf-using-google-gemini-ai
- AI-Powered PDF Interaction – Integrates Google Gemini (or similar LLM) with a PDF parser so users can upload documents and directly ask questions in natural language, eliminating manual searching or scrolling.
- Smart Features & Applications – Supports summarization, keyword extraction, contextual Q&A, and multi-PDF analysis, making it useful for students, researchers, and professionals handling large volumes of    information.

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 Upload and process PDF files in real-time
- 🧩 Extract and chunk text for efficient embedding
- 🔍 Perform semantic search using FAISS vector database
- 💬 Ask natural language questions about your documents
- ⚡ Get AI-generated, context-rich answers
- 🌐 Simple Streamlit-based interface for easy use

## ⚙️ System Design
- Architecture Flow
- User uploads PDF → processed via Streamlit interface.
- Text Extraction → using PyPDF2 (and OCR if needed).
- Text Chunking & Cleaning → large text split into smaller sections.
- Embeddings Generation → each chunk is embedded using Gemini embeddings through LangChain.
- Vector Storage → embeddings stored in FAISS for fast retrieval.
- Query Handling → user enters a question; query is embedded and compared with stored vectors.
- Response Generation → top-matching chunks passed to Gemini AI for contextual answer generation.
- Output Display → result shown on Streamlit UI with relevant text references.



## 🔍 Working Process

- Upload PDF → System extracts text.
- Text converted into embeddings and stored in FAISS.
- User asks question → query embedding compared with stored chunks.
- Gemini AI uses retrieved context to generate response.
- Streamlit displays the final answer instantly.

## 🧾 Future Scope
- 🌍 Add multi-language support using translation APIs
- 🤖 Integrate voice-based question answering
- ☁️ Enable cloud-based storage for large documents
- 🔒 Enhance security and access control
- 📈 Implement document summarization and analytics dashboard
